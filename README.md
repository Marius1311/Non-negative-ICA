# Non-negative ICA
A python algorithm for non-negative independent component analysis (ICA) as described by [Plumbley, 2003](10.1109/TNN.2003.810616). 

Non-negative ICA is a matrix decomposition algorithm that given a matrix X finds two matrices A and S such that X = AS, where S is non-negative and describes the ouptut of a set of independent sources.
